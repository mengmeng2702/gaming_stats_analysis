# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to import the two .csv files and the the .json file, explore and clean, and ultimately merge them all into a single dataframe in pandas. We are also considering using sqlalchemy to push the data into postgresql.

## Database Storage
Our primary project objective may not require database storage. If the storage is necessary, we will use postgresql.

## Machine Learning
*Please see machine learning section*

## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau for our Dashboards.
